== Next ==

* implement a vector version of available jobs

== Miscellaneous ==

* add specs
* add scalariform
* add microbenchmarking
* drop sparse map for array
* allow available jobs to be filterable (see dark knight filter) (this is a basic heuristic)
* add heuristic framework based on distance to hasJob (how many jobs needed to get to dark knight)
* design query language (one character has darknight, one character has mystic, one character has time mage and white mage)
* add convenience exo constructors to aid with testing
